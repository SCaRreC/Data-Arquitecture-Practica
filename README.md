# Data-Arquitecture-Practica

In this repository, we will do an exercise in which we connect Hadoop with ElasticSearch. Specifically, we will establish a connection between Hive and an ElasticSearch index. At the end we can add a visuzlization dashboard in Kibana, to obtain a great potential of Obtention, processing and Big Data management.

Each one of the steps to do this, has a section in which a screenshot of the different configurations is shown.

PART 1 - Configuration ElasticSearch-Hadoop (ES-Hadoop)
